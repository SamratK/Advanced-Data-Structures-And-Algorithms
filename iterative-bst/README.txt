Iterative BST
Memory efficient implementation of binary search tree.
Operations of search, insert and delete are implemented using iterative procedure than the usual recursive method.
If height of BST is h then for search, insert or delete operation an auxiliary space of O(h) is used for method stacks in recursive method.
In iterative method same operations are done with constant space.
